# InfoDump
InfoDump is a simple django-based file storage website for topics you are researching.
The intention is for it to be used to aid in my own personal research and to store notes
during my studies, but anyone can register to use.

Streamer app - meat of the site. Interactions between focuses and infodumps
home app - handles authorisation
scraping file in streamer - will flesh out eventually to automatically add resources to a users
